# population-estimates (development version)

# population-estimates 1.1.0

- The repository was renamed to `population-estimates`.
- The codebase has been restructured for better maintainability.
- Dependencies were updated to their latest versions.
- Data that can be derived from other sources (e.g., `state`, `region`) has been removed in order to reduce data files and simplify updates. Use the [`geobr`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/reference/read_municipality.html) R package to gather geographical data.
- Files now are saved in `csv`, `rds`, and `parquet` formats.
- Documentation and metadata files were revised and improved.
